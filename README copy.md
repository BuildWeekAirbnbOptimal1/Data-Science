# Datascience

For this project, our goal is to accurately predict the price of a potential listing for AirBnB in the city of Berlin, Germany.

## Notebook

The notebook for this repo 'Airbnb_working_model.ipynb' focuses on cleaning and tidying up the dataset 'listings_summary.csv' which
is one of many CSVs contained in a zip file downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/brittabettendorf/berlin-airbnb-data.
